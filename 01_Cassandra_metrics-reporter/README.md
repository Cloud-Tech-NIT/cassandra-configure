# Apache Cassandra's metrics-reporter

We will configure Cassandra's built in ` metrics-reporter ` to extract and publish Cassandra metrics to a local text file. <br>

```
metrics-reporter.yaml
```
Download this configuration file and place it in the same folder where we have our ` cassandra.yaml ` file. <br>
We will copy this file to all of our Cassandra nodes. <br>

### This configuration change is required on each of our Cassandra nodes.
